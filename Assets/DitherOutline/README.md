# Dither Outline

Create an outline of the Sprite and give it a dithered look.

Apply DitherOutline component to a SpriteRenderer and click "Create Outline"
It will create another sprite, child of the current sprite with the effect.

The Krugs image does not belong to me, it belongs to Riot Games, it's from League of Legends' in-client tournament Clash.
